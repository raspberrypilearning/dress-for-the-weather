## Dress for the weather

In this resource you're going to write a program that will allow a user to type in a city they're travelling to, and the date they'll be arriving. The program will then use [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) to find out what the weather is like in that city at that time, and advise the user on what they should wear when they arrive.
