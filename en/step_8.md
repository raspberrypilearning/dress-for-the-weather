## Challenge: More weather

There are other methods that you can use on your weather object. Here are a few of them:

```python
weather.get_dewpoint 	weather.get_heat_index      weather.get_humidex 	      weather.get_humidity    weather.get_pressure 	      weather.get_status
weather.get_snow        weather.get_sunrise_time    weather.get_sunset_time 	
weather.get_visibility_distance
```

Can you use any of these to give your user a little more information? Perhaps you could find out what time they are travelling at, and tell them if it will be day or night, for instance.
